# FlappyBird
A Flappy Bird game built with Python (Pygame Zero).

## Compatibility Note
If you're using an OS other than macOS, please modify the `FlappyBird.py` file as follows:

- **Delete line 2:** `import os`  
- **Delete line 3:** `os.environ["SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS"] = "50, 100"`

This ensures the game works correctly on other platforms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame Zero

## How to Run
1. Install Pygame Zero: `pip install pgzero`
2. Run the game: `pgzrun FlappyBird.py`

## Note on Code Quality
This project was one of my earlier Python projects. While it works as intended, the code structure and organization may not reflect my current coding abilities.

Enjoy the game!
